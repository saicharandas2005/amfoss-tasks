# Programming

This one...this, I litrally had no words to describe it. This was like I spent more time working on this.Though I had a lit bit knowledge in java during my 10th but I forgot syntaxes of java though I had the logic ,this forced me to learn python and do the stuff.During solving this I was helped by google for some of the import statements,making and enabelling the list etc...and also most of the commands.Though it wasnot easy the programming gave a source for me to learn various things.
