## My views about the tasks
In my point of view the tasks were amazing.though I had not completed all of them they had given me a good idea of how the programming will be ,how finding and learning the things on our own helps and the mainly the research point of this tasks was very exiting thing to do even that sometimes I felt frustated while doing the tasks.I had not attempted all the tasks so I may not be able to give a brief discriptionon every single task but till the tasks I had attempted it was way exiting.By this this gave me a lot of things to learn and mainly the google was the saviour in each and every task.Thanks to my seniors who were helpful in every single difficulty I had faced while doing the tasks.
## My Introduction
Hii all my seniors, I am Sai Charan Das from Srikakulam, Andhra Pradesh.I got to know about amFOSS from the source when I planned to get into Amrita and since than I was facinated to it and I choose this campus for mainly to get into amFOSS becauce the stuff that amFOSS provides was very admiring.I am a beginner to programming field and I hope I will be doing and will be improving myself in every possible manner .I feel the club will provide me ample opportunities to develop my skills and knowledge.While solving the tasks I got to do something more than the other as a particular time proceeds.I  strongly feel that I will be learning lot more things and I will be developing myself each and every day from here.Thank You for all seiors who provided their valuable suggestion by spending their valuable time.
